# Tutorial Folder for _cosmicBallet_

This folder consists of three tutorials which provide users with the necessary tools and knowledge to utilize the **cosmicBallet** package. The three tutorials are:

- Solar_System.ipynb: A simulation of the Solar System using the NBodySimulator module and working with stars and planets.
- BlackHole_Merger.ipynb: A simulation of a Binary Black Hole Merger (working purely with black holes).
- Stellar_Precession.ipynb: A simulation of stars orbiting a Black Hole (working with black holes and stars).

The results of the simulations are stored in the _results_ directory of the repository.
